Good day! I am a noob looking to get into Web Development. I am currently learning the basics of Git, GitHub, and HTML through The Odin Project. After this lesson, I expect to be comfortable using the basic functions and commands of Git, which is an essential skill for any Web Developer.

For this specific project, I will be creating a barebones recipes website to showcase my current knowledge.
