    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a basic chicken pancit that has a flavor that is unbeatable. Made by Filipinos.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 boneless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package dried rice noodles</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy-based liquid seasoning (such as Maggi®), or to taste</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
        <li>½ large head cabbage, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 carrots, julienned</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a pot of water to a boil over high heat. Add chicken thighs and boil until no longer pink in the centers and juices run clear, about 30 minutes. Strain broth into a bowl to reserve. Shred chicken thighs using 2 forks.</li>
        <li>Place noodles in a large bowl and pour in hot chicken broth, adding hot water to cover if needed. Set aside until noodles are softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Blanch noodles with cold water and drain well. Place into a bowl and add soy seasoning, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and sesame oil. Mix well and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat remaining olive oil in a skillet or large wok over medium-high heat. Saute garlic in the hot oil until it begins to brown, about 1 minute. Add onion and cook for 2 minutes. Add chicken, cabbage, and carrots. Stir-fry for 3 to 4 minutes; season with garlic salt. Mix chicken mixture with noodles, add soy seasoning to taste, and serve.</li>
    </ol>
